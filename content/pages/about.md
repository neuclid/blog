Title: About
Date: 2018-02-04

This site will hopefully curate/condense my scattered thoughts/learning on the *too-many* things I’m interested in. I wish to preserve my sanity with this outlet as well as create some sanity for those who are in need.

I'm not a good writer. But if you hang around, you'll notice significant improvement *very* quickly.

The macrotopics can be categorised into:

* Coding (primarily)
* Technology trends
* Culture
* Ethics

Specifically, the topics I’m currently focussed on include (but not restricted to):

* ML/AI
* Cryptography and Blockchains (that includes the run-of-mill coin-related stuff sometimes)

There will also be immature musings on:

* VR/AR/MR
* A little bit of Frontend engineering
* Random coding epiphanies

If you're a programmer, these are the languages I primarily discuss:

* JS
* Python
* Scheme (I gobbled it up while doing the SICP book)
* Haskell (currently learning)

The blog will occasionally read like some serious dude for want of accuracy in conveying information, but I hope to spice it up now and then. The problem with humor is that occasionally you cross the boundary and it’s not funny anymore. And whoever can predict what reeeaaallyy crossed the line? Also, the point being discussed is almost entirely missed. 

Oh well, I’ll still try. Because I’ll be disappointed in myself if I didn’t.

**Most importantly**, I hope you find something worthwhile here to spend your time on. The thing I value most in humans is them spending their time on each other. The very act of paying attention to another person is a concrete step towards selflessness and freedom. I take it very seriously. After all, time is the most valuable currency in a seriously accelerating world such as ours. OH, and maybe bitcoins. Probably bitcoins. BTC? Moon?

Kidding.
