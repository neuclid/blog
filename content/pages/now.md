Title: Now
Date: 2018-02-04

*Inspiration: [nownownow](http://nownownow.com/about) by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now). I highly encourage you try this yourself too. It helps declutter your tasks, sort out your priorities and be more honest with your progress because you’re committing publicly.*

I’m currently away from work and focused full-time on learning.

### Courses I’m doing

* Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera. Already did it once in college, but redoing it to brush up on fundamentals and later pursue the DeepLearning track that he teaches too.
* [JS30](https://courses.wesbos.com/) by Wes Bos. Using [this](https://yhabib.github.io/JavaScript30/) for help.
* EdX – Introduction to Linux (because I realized I need to dig deeper)
* EdX – Quantum Cryptography (just being curious)

### Books I’m reading

* Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
* What If? by Randall Munroe

### Things I’m mulling over

* Moving my blog to ~Github + Hugo~ Pelican!
